This is a graphing script used as a demonstration for my physics final thesis.
The purpose of this python script is to visually present the interference caused by multiple sound emitters on a 2D plane. The theory is to try to create a singular beam of sound at a controlled direction, and cancel out most noise in other directions. all of the emitters are placed on a single line in equal spacing, he phase of all of the emitters are sinchronised. 

The python script uses the numpy and matplotlib libraries.
Do note, I wrote this by combining things i saw online haphazardly, the code doesnt have nearly as much documentation as it should.
